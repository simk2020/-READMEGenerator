## Title - Generate a Professional Readme Using this READMEGenerator

## Github Link :https://github.com/simk2020/READMEGenerator.git

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include 
what the app is for, 
how to use the app, 
how to install it, 
how to report issues, and
how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 


[Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 

Review the [Good README Guide](../../01-html-git-css/supplemental/good_readme_guide.md) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.
- how a user would invoke the application from the command line.
- how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.
- must demonstrate a generated README that matches the user input and has a functioning table of contents.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with :
the title of my project and 
sections entitled Description, 
Table of Contents, 
Installation:
Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).



Usage, 
License, 
Contributing, 
Tests, and 
Questions.

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
